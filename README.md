# ec601_hw1
    Our homework1 is aimed to pick one example in (https://github.com/opencv/opencv), run it and modify it.
    We use Python for the openCV project, so you probably need to install python IDE for the code and set up openCV 
    environment firstly.
    
    You should download all the files listed in (https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and you can find the texture_flow.py in
    the path opencv-master/samples/python/texture_flow.py, then run the code.
     
    If you want to change the input to your own image, you could modify the path of the image.
